    Other algorithms are "grammar" and "markov".

    "grammar" is like syllables, but that two or more groups can
    share tokens (be it a syllable, letter, diphtong, ...)

        $group SC VL END
        s i la
        r a na

        $group SV CL VL END
        a n a ya
        i l e na

    This is equalent to this context-free grammar (Backusâ€“Naur notation)
        <output> ::= <SV><VL><END> | <SV><CL><VL><END>
        <SC> ::= "s" | "v",
        <SV> ::= "a" | "i"
        <VL> ::= "i" | "a" | "a" | "e"
        <CL> ::= "n" | "l"
        <END> ::= "la" | "na" | "ya" | "na"

    Both group's VL and END token are shared. This can get out of hand
    fast, so it's not recommended to maintain one with fifty samples.
    "syllables" is more suited for that as each group is self-contained.

    "markov" loads samples like static, but constructs new unique names.
    However, it needs a lot of samples to be effective and would make
    this example more complicated than it needs to be.

        $skip NONE
        $lists first.male last
        Tonn Actus
        Desolas Arterius
        Saren Arterius
        Chellick
        NONE Corinthus
        ...

    Another thing to keep in mind is that two $options in a row have
    their values concaterated, making

        $replace sh 5
        $replace th 7

    equalent to

        $replace sh 5 th 7

    One last thing is that "markov" does not avoid samples by default, but
    does so if {"flags": "as"} is added to "options" in the metadata json.
    Here are all the flags it uses.
